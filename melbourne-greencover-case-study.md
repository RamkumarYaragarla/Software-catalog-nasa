#Case Study: Green Cover Analysis of Melbourne using Sentinel-2, EPIC, and GIBS

Monitoring urban green cover is critical for understanding city ecology, climate resilience, and environmental health. In this case study, I Hug Trees analyzed the green cover of Melbourne using a combination of Sentinel-2 imagery, EPIC daily Earth observations, and GIBS weather overlays.

For detailed vegetation mapping, Sentinel-2 imagery accessed via the Microsoft Planetary Computer (MPC) was used to compute high-resolution NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) across Melbourne. This 10-meter resolution analysis focused on urban and peri-urban areas, identifying patterns of vegetation growth and stress over time. Between March and September 2025, residential green spaces showed an approximate 4.8% increase in NDVI values, while industrial and transport corridors exhibited minor declines, highlighting the interplay of urban planning and vegetation health.

To complement this, daily global snapshots from the EPIC instrument aboard NASA’s DSCOVR satellite were used to track Melbourne’s “Earth pulse,” providing context for seasonal variations and overall vegetation trends. Weather and environmental conditions were visualized using GIBS overlays, allowing the integration of temperature, rainfall, and cloud cover into the green cover analysis.

The results were presented in an interactive, web-based map with NDVI time-lapses and trend overlays. This approach allows urban planners, educators, and citizens to easily understand green cover dynamics and make informed decisions about urban greening initiatives.

This case study illustrates how open satellite data and cloud-based analysis platforms like MPC can empower local research initiatives. By combining Sentinel-2 imagery, EPIC monitoring, and GIBS environmental overlays, small teams can produce credible insights for sustainable urban planning and environmental awareness.
